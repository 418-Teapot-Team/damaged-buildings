# Damaged Buildings Hackathon Project

Welcome to the Damaged Buildings Hackathon Project! This repository integrates three core modules that work together to deliver an engaging and efficient user experience.

## Modules Overview

### 1. Parsers Module

- **Core Module ‚öôÔ∏è:** Transforms raw, unstructured data into structured information through cleaning, deduplication, merging, and structurization. It is the heart of the system, feeding reliable data to external analytical setups.
- **Technologies:** Leverages robust scraping algorithms, parsing libraries, regular expressions, and data validation tools within Python's ecosystem to ensure precision and efficiency.

### 2. AI Chat Module

- **Functionality:** Provides natural, human-like conversational experiences using advanced NLP techniques üí¨. Works in tandem with the Bot Module.
- **Technologies:** Utilizes Python's powerful NLP libraries (LangGraph, Llama) and modern AI APIs for smooth interactions.

### 3. Bot Module

- **Functionality:** Telegram Bot that serves as an intelligent assistant ü§ñ that handles user conversations and command execution. Integrates closely with the AI Chat Module.
- **Technologies:** Built on lightweight Grammy framework with a focus on asynchronous event handling and RESTful integrations.
